# :fleur_de_lis: Simple sequence alignment in VB6

To find similarities between two words, a manual comparison is required. For words between 4 and 8 letters, such a task can be performed by any of us without the use of a computer. However, what if the objects of comparison are entire phrases/sequences/files? Then the number of possibilities for different matches increases exponentially and nobody can do it by paper computing (to my knowledge). Computational solutions for these problems exist, such as different implementations of sequence alignment algorithms. Here, the implementation of global sequence alignment is shown in detail. The implementation si designed in Visual Basic 6.0.
